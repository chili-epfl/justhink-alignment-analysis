371.721	373.670	A	and then go to bern and then go to basel .
373.998	379.820	B	or we can go to mount zurich mount basel mount bern mount neuchatel mount interlaken .
380.044	386.497	A	no i think it would be better if we go to , mount zurich , and then bern .
387.116	388.224	B	i don't know .
387.169	387.669	A	we
388.467	395.331	A	or we should go mount saint gallen to mount zurich .
397.076	398.229	A	to mount
398.933	400.030	A	bern  .
400.030	407.346	A	wait no to mount basel to mount to mount neuchatel to mount bern then interlaken .
407.965	409.850	B	to mount zurich ?
410.272	415.420	B	mount bern to mount neuchatel to mount basel to mount and then mount interlaken ?
415.983	418.459	B	you kind of like go there i'm not sure that could happen though .

424.987	426.591	B	so it has to be a straight line .

427.452	428.245	A	yeah
430.307	432.668	A	yeah so we should go
433.118	434.075	A	i don't mind

437.564	442.346	B	and then go mount bern then mount basel or mount basel and then bern mount bern and then neuchatel .
440.996	445.582	A	i think and then mount basel .
442.740	449.155	B	i think what we should do is mount saint gallen mount zurich mount basel mount neuchatel mount bern then mount interlaken .
449.606	453.208	A	i don't think i've got anything you've just said bob .
451.773	458.666	B	so you like it but you just skip bern and then you have bern after inter- before inter- (uhh) interlaken .
459.876	461.952	B	or finish out mount bern
459.903	461.085	A	you s-
462.422	466.318	A	i think we should finish at mount interlaken because we started we started
466.684	468.569	A	(uhh) mount montreux .
467.134	473.295	B	no we have to finish at mount (umm) montreux because she wants all of them , there .

607.692	608.262	B	4 .
610.175	611.075	A	okay .

650.532	651.883	B	this one (uhh) .
653.199	655.456	B	and then you go to mount bern then mount basel .
655.444	657.076	A	mount bern .
656.260	657.188	B	yep bern .
657.526	659.074	A	from mount neuchatel ?
