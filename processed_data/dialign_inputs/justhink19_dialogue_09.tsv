B	uh
B	ann ?
A	yeah .
B	if you did from mount montreux
B	to interlaken , mount interlaken .
B	that would make it less expensive than if you went to mount montreux then to zermatt .
B	um
B	i 've read the instructions and it says you could see the cost of it .
B	in swiss francs but how would you find that out ?
B	if she does it i see the cost .
B	oh , okay .
A	oh .
B	so , ann .
B	you are the interactive that 's right .
B	or do you have the dark screen .
A	no i have the
A	interactive .
B	so .
A	you have the abstract .
B	yes .
B	um could you go to mount montreux and then mount interlaken .
B	to see
A	mount
A	montreux to interlaken .
B	that 's 4 .
B	okay .
B	then , can you erase that ?
B	oh , okay .
A	now we 've swapped .
B	okay .
A	i think every time we erase something then we swap .
B	okay .
B	how much is that ?
A	2 .
B	okay , 2 franc , 2 francs .
A	it says 2 .
B	hmm
B	how much is that ?
A	3 .
B	so we have 4 2 3 .
A	we 've swapped again .
A	yes so
B	try mount luzern to mount bern .
A	luzern to mount bern ?
B	yeah .
B	i think you have to touch east so that 's 3 francs .
B	oh , okay .
B	um
B	i think we should start to mount montreux , and then finish at mount interlaken .
B	you ?
A	yeah .
B	so kind of like go around in a snake instead of having to stop .
A	so should we , go to mount
A	basel .
B	you should erase the mount bern and do it from mount luzern to mount davos i think .
A	okay but you would have to do it because
B	yeah , i think though i 'm not sure though .
A	okay .
B	yes i will .
B	so how about this how much is that ?
A	3 .
B	we 've got 3 uh 2 3 2 .
A	yeah so 4 2 3 2 .
B	it 's 6 8 .
A	wait .
A	3 3 6 yeah at 8 .
B	so should i do mount saint gallen ?
B	so we would have to go mount davos and mount saint gallen .
B	and then mount zurich then mount bern to mount basel then mount interlaken .
B	oh no then
B	um
B	mount neuchatel and then back to mount interlaken right ?
B	right ?
B	so we go around and like we go to mount saint , gallen and then mount zurich then mount basel then mount bern
B	then mount
A	so from
B	neuchatel , then interlaken
B	or
B	you go from mount neuchatel to mount bern to mount interlaken .
A	no i think the first idea was good .
B	first idea was good okay i 'm gon na go track this way , but
B	no .
B	no because i 'll go twice on it .
B	oh if i go here , no i wanna i wanna draw i wanna draw i wanna draw .
B	okay you try mount davos to mount saint gallen .
B	so that 's
A	2 .
B	2 3 3 2 .
A	2 3 3 2 .
B	wait there is uh so each track was 2 then you go 3 3 and then you go 2 then you 3 3 and then you go 2 then you 3 3 and then you go 2 that looks like it .
A	probably .
A	so how it 's going so far ?
A	wait .
A	so , so from , mount saint
B	saint gallen .
A	yeah .
B	try mount zurich .
A	okay .
B	or you can go mount bern and then come back and then mount basel .
A	i think we should go to mount zurich .
A	and then go to bern and then go to basel .
B	or we can go to mount zurich mount basel mount bern mount neuchatel mount interlaken .
A	no i think it would be better if we go to , mount zurich , and then bern .
B	i do n't know .
A	we
A	or we should go mount saint gallen to mount zurich .
A	to mount
A	bern .
A	wait no to mount basel to mount to mount neuchatel to mount bern then interlaken .
B	to mount zurich ?
B	mount bern to mount neuchatel to mount basel to mount and then mount interlaken ?
B	you kind of like go there i 'm not sure that could happen though .
B	because i ca n't cross over .
A	oh yeah true .
B	i 've tried that .
A	true .
A	so , yeah okay .
B	so it has to be a straight line .
B	or it can have zigzags but never overlap .
A	yeah
A	yeah so we should go
A	i do n't mind
A	uh i think we should go to mount zurich though .
B	and then go mount bern then mount basel or mount basel and then bern mount bern and then neuchatel .
A	i think and then mount basel .
B	i think what we should do is mount saint gallen mount zurich mount basel mount neuchatel mount bern then mount interlaken .
A	i do n't think i 've got anything you 've just said bob .
B	or finish out mount bern
A	i think we should finish at mount interlaken because we started we started
A	uh mount montreux .
B	no we have to finish at mount um montreux because she wants all of them , there .
A	yeah because we 've started there as well .
A	okay .
A	so where should
B	i think we should go mount zurich first .
A	okay so from mount saint gallen
A	to zurich .
B	to mount zurich .
A	how much was it ?
B	3 .
A	okay .
B	so it 's 2 3 3 oh but mount interlaken to mount montreux is 4 .
A	yeah .
B	that is weird .
A	yeah .
B	okay you are next move .
B	we should go to mount bern then mount basel .
A	okay , so should i go
B	i think so , i 'm not sure though .
A	oh try it .
B	it 's another 3 .
A	yeah .
A	so it goes
B	so should i go to mount basel ?
A	yeah i think .
B	then mount neuchatel then mount interlaken then
A	yeah i think we should i , i think we should .
B	mount montreux , or should we go
A	oh .
B	or should we go um mount montreux then mount interlaken ?
B	we finish at interlaken .
A	we should finish at interlaken .
B	that was 4 franc 4 francs just to get from mount
A	no we should n't we should n't we should n't .
A	it 's too much
A	well wait i mean
B	wait how much is this ?
A	4 .
B	it was 4 same way .
B	how much is this ?
A	3 .
B	then or we can just
B	go to mount neuchatel mount basel then mount bern .
B	because it 's weird , because this is kind of like a circle , a circle has no end .
A	yeah .
B	has a beginning but no end .
A	yeah .
A	okay so , from
B	so we can start anywhere and end up at the same place .
B	i 'm not sure
A	so mount basel then bern .
A	okay .
B	i 'm not sure though .
A	basel .
A	um
A	and then mount bern .
B	mount
B	yeah , i think so .
A	wait how much was the
B	4 .
A	okay .
B	oh wait , if we if we do n't do that if you erase mount basel
B	and then make mount basel go to mount interlaken then mount neuchatel to mount bern .
B	so kind of like rearrange it .
A	so should i erase the one we just did ?
B	yeah i think so but i 'm gon na have to erase one too .
A	okay .
B	okay .
B	go .
A	erased .
B	so .
B	mount basel , no , mount basel goes to no that wo n't work actually we have to redo that one .
B	this one uh .
B	and then you go to mount bern then mount basel .
A	mount bern .
B	yep bern .
A	from mount neuchatel ?
B	no actually you have to go mount bern you have to do mount zurich oh this is so confusing uh
B	if we went this way and then go up and meet there .
B	i think what we should do is go mount neuchatel to mount bern , and erase mount zurich and make mount zurich go to mount basel .
A	okay , so should i do it ?
B	so where is mount
A	i 'm just gon na draw the thing from neuchatel to bern .
B	okay .
A	first .
A	how much is it ?
B	5 .
A	okay and then should i erase mount zurich ?
B	i thought uh
B	i think actually i am confused i think i should do it we should just do a normal circle , and meet at bern .
A	yeah okay .
B	it 's really getting confused .
A	so which one should i erase ?
B	the 5 .
B	uh mount neuchatel to mount bern .
A	so the long one .
B	yeah long one .
A	that one ?
B	yes .
A	okay .
B	i think we should go there how much that is that ?
B	okay .
B	um how much with that ?
A	um the one from neuchatel to basel , 4 .
B	how much was that ?
B	3 .
A	3
B	i think we should submit .
A	now ?
B	yeah because it comes like a circle .
A	so press .
A	okay .
B	what ?
A	8 franc .
B	oh okay .
A	so we have to start again .
A	away from the minimum , so you have to have
B	okay .
A	8 francs .
B	how did you , 4 so we have to take away the 4 .
A	so
B	if we started from mount , so wait , we should if we start from mount interlaken then mount zermatt and then we do that , just we take out mount montreux , the things .
B	and then we put mount neuchatel .
B	to mount
B	basel so we have 4 minus , okay .
B	so we erase the the things to go away from mount montreux .
A	wait
B	so
A	wait which one ?
B	okay .
B	uh try to uh erase the mount interlaken and mount zermatt the ones to go to montreux .
A	this one ?
B	what ?
B	which one ?
B	the one that um
A	the montreux to mount mount zermatt .
B	yeah .
A	it 's not working .
B	my gosh .
B	this one i want this one .
B	wait what ?
A	it wo n't let me erase .
B	oh .
A	no i do n't it wo n't because mount bern is joining them to joining them together .
A	yeah .
B	then
B	you can take then mount zermatt can go to mount interlaken .
A	okay .
B	and then erase the 4 , to go to mount neuchatel .
A	should i do it to zermatt ?
B	no wait no uh um .
B	so that one goes to there .
B	oh that good .
B	my idea 's not gon na work .
A	wait .
A	so we erase the long one
B	if that goes together oh actually it will .
B	it will uh .
B	you you have to erase the mount neuchatel to mount interlaken .
A	mount neuchatel .
A	no because they have to be joined .
B	they do ?
A	yeah .
A	otherwise you because if then if it breaks two bits apart then uh you ca n't erase .
B	then you should try mount montreux to mount neuchatel and then erase the interlaken part .
A	mount montreux to mount neuchatel .
B	yeah .
A	montreux to mount neuchatel .
B	it is 2 francs , okay .
A	okay i did that .
B	now .
A	then you erase the one you wanted to .
B	little
B	there .
B	and then from interlaken to mount zermatt .
A	okay .
B	it still 4 francs .
A	hmm
B	can we submit as many times we want ?
A	yeah .
B	i 'm gon na submit .
A	waiting for your
A	7 francs .
B	what ?
B	what ?
A	the minimum is 7 francs .
B	uh we have to get 7 francs less .
B	we know mount zermatt to mount interlaken is 4 francs and we know mount neuchatel to mount basel is 4 francs .
B	we do n't want
A	one , one of them you said was 5 .
B	which , what ?
A	i ca n't remember which one that was though .
A	i think it was mount basel to mount zurich .
B	no that was not never connected let me see .
B	uh the one that was 5 was neuchatel to bern .
A	yeah .
A	it 's hard .
B	um
B	it 's very hard .
B	how about mount montreux to neuchatel ?
A	mount montreux to
B	no , no , no .
A	um
B	mount neuchatel to mount interlaken , no , how would you get this to connected .
B	how many places so if you press mount montreux how many places can it go ?
A	mount montreux um
A	it can go to interlaken mount zurich , mount zermatt sorry , and mount neuchatel , so it can go three places .
B	um
B	okay , how many times , how many places can now interlaken go ?
A	it can go
A	to mount bern mount luzern mount zermatt mount montreux and mount neuchatel so it can go one two three four five .
A	do you want , that 's a
B	if no uh if , mount neuchatel goes , if mount montreux can go anyway else but not connect to um interlaken .
A	hmm ?
B	can mount interlaken go any way ?
A	any way , what ?
B	can can mount , how would you connect mount montreux with the rest without interlaken if you can not touch mount interlaken .
A	i 'm not sure because
B	oh , i have an idea !
B	if you go mount neuchatel to mount zermatt and just skip interlaken .
B	now mount neuchatel touch interlaken .
A	so
A	wait
B	it goes like kind of like
A	um wait what ?
B	so , mount neuchatel goes to mount montreux .
