A	that 's 3 .
A	yeah okay .
A	okay .
A	yeah okay .
A	it 's better to go from mount basel to mount interlaken because that costs less money , i think .
A	okay , uh .
A	i think that cost less , then last time .
B	um yeah , let 's submit .
A	yeah .
A	oh so what 's the minimum is 9 i think , wait .
A	we had the price which is 29 , so
A	i think we used to do it one more time .
B	um
A	okay your turn first .
A	why do n't you go from a different mountain this time ?
B	maybe mount bern ?
A	where ?
B	mount bern .
A	okay start from there .
A	maybe go to mount basel after .
A	that might cost less .

A	yeah .
A	oh no that costs more .
A	uh
B	we should erase it .
A	yeah , i 'll erase it .
A	that , that 's better okay .
A	so , go from mount bern
A	to straight to mount zurich i think maybe that 's better .
A	that would cost a lot .
A	yeah .
A	then mount saint gallen maybe ?
A	yeah , it 's better .
A	i 'm gon na go from mount bern to mount basel .
A	oh you 're gon na go from saint gallen right down to mount davos .
A	yeah that 's better .
A	so we cut the 5 out .

A	yeah , maybe like that 's better .
A	and then mount luzern to mount zermatt .
A	yeah , perfect .
A	oh good , should i go to mount
A	interlaken interlaken or mount montreux ?

A	interlaken .
B	interlaken .
